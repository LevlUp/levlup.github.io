	  <p>Hi, My Name is Mitch. I'm currently diving deep into Podio implementations/customizations; harnessing automation and integrations to make workflows more efficient; using real-time dashboards to foster performance increases and drive smart business decisions. I also have experience in Content Management Systems and Web Development in several languages/frameworks. My true passion is for learning. I love to spend late nights learning new technologies and approaches to refactor existing projects.</p>
